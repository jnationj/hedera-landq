🧭 A. Ownership & Minting Logic

✅ 1. “Each parcel creates a unique NFT.”
Perfect. This is exactly what Hedera’s HTS Non-Fungible Unique model is built for — every token ID under one collection represents a distinct asset (like your land parcel).

✅ 2. “Single registry token (created once), users mint under it.”

That’s also the correct and efficient Hedera pattern.

⚙️ How it works in Hedera:

In HTS, you can think of your “registry” as a single NFT collection, which is technically one token ID on Hedera.

When you call createNonFungibleToken() (via IHederaTokenService), you create one collection (e.g. "LandQRegistry") that will hold all parcels (token serials 1, 2, 3, …).

Each minted NFT under it represents one land parcel (so serial numbers become your tokenIds).

👉 Example in concept:

// Once at deployment
(address tokenAddress, int response) = hts.createNonFungibleToken(
  HederaToken({
    name: "LandQ Registry",
    symbol: "LQ",
    treasury: msg.sender,
    ...
  })
);

// Later, when a user mints:
hts.mintToken(tokenAddress, 1, ["ipfs://landParcelMetadataCID"]);


Now, each NFT serial number (1, 2, 3…) corresponds to a unique land parcel —
and you can associate each with its coordinate hash and metadata.

That means your previous design (single collection, multiple lands minted) is perfectly valid and optimal for Hedera.
The only reason to have multiple collections (one per state) would be administrative: if each state DAO wants to manage its own treasury keys and fee rules — but that can come later.

🧾 B. Verification Process

✅ 3. “Fixed list of approved verifiers (state land agencies).”

That’s excellent, and it maps cleanly to a registry + authority model:

The deployer (or DAO) is the root registry admin.

Each state’s land agency can be a verifier added to a mapping:

mapping(string => address) public stateVerifier;


When a new verifier is approved, you emit:

event VerifierAdded(string state, address verifier);


and the frontend (and Mirror Node) can instantly pick that up.

✅ 4. “Verifier registered on-chain, and frontend reflects status.”

Perfect.
That means LandVerifier.sol will:

Store and update verification status (mapping(uint256 => bool) verifiedLands)

Emit events (LandVerified(uint256 tokenId, bool verified))

Be queryable directly by the frontend and other contracts (isVerified(tokenId)).

This keeps your state machine fully on-chain and verifiable by any user or DeFi protocol.

💰 C. Lending Mechanism

✅ 5. Stable HTS token (LandUSD)

That’s a very smart choice.

Users receive predictable value.

You can mint your own LandUSD HTS token (fungible).

Later, it can integrate with HBAR lending (your “HBAR-Fi” idea).

✅ 6. “Lock NFT in escrow (non-transferable while collateralized)”

Excellent — this maps exactly to Hedera’s token freeze/transfer lock features.

Use HTS “freeze key” logic from KeyHelper.sol.

LandLending.sol calls freezeToken(tokenAddress, tokenId) when loan is active.

Once repaid → unfreezeToken() to release it.

No need to implement custom transfer restrictions; HTS handles it natively. ✅

❓ 7. Default handling — what’s best?

Here’s the reasoning:

Option	What Happens	Pros	Cons
Auto-transfer NFT to lender	Lending contract calls transferNFT() to lender	Full on-chain liquidation	Requires careful borrower/lender permissions
Emit “Defaulted” event only	Off-chain protocol handles liquidation	Simpler, less risk	Not fully trustless

✅ Recommendation:
Start with event-based default — emit LoanDefaulted(tokenId, lender, borrower, amount) —
and later upgrade to automated transfer once you’re ready for on-chain liquidation logic (e.g. after DAO governance adds policies).

This gives flexibility and avoids forced transfers in early versions.

⚙️ D. Governance & DAO Control

✅ 8. DAO controls minting fee, verification fee, and verifier registration

That’s excellent and realistic.
You can model this as:

One root DAO contract or multisig account controlling global parameters.

Each state’s DAO/verifier
