# 🏗️ **LandQ — Decentralized Land Ownership, Verification & Lending on Hedera**

---

### **Slide 1: Title & Vision**

**Title:**
**LandQ** — Decentralized Land Ownership, Verification & Lending on Hedera

**Team Name:**
**Team LandQ (Africa)**

**Value Proposition (One-liner):**

> Empowering landowners across Africa to securely own, verify, and unlock value from their land using Hedera’s trusted, government-ready blockchain.

---

### **Slide 2: The Problem**

* **Over 90% of Africa’s rural land** is **unregistered or disputed** (World Bank, 2024).
* **Land verification is slow and corruptible**, relying on fragmented paper registries.
* **Banks reject unverified land titles**, limiting access to capital for millions.
* Lack of **public, tamper-proof records** leads to **fraud, double-selling, and loss of trust** in property systems.

> **Core Pain Point:** Land in Africa is valuable — but unusable as collateral because ownership is unverifiable.

---

### **Slide 3: The Solution (The Hook)**

**LandQ** transforms land ownership into **tokenized, verifiable NFTs** on the **Hedera network**.

**Our Core Modules:**

1. 🧱 **LandNFT.sol** — Tokenizes land parcels as HTS NFTs with GPS, metadata & IPFS images.
2. ✅ **LandVerifier.sol** — On-chain verification handled by authorized regional verifiers (e.g., land registries).
3. 💰 **LandLending.sol** — Enables verified land NFTs to be used as **DeFi collateral** for loans.

**User Flow:**

> Upload Land → Mint NFT → Request Verification → Get Verified → Borrow Against NFT

**Key Advantage:**
Tamper-proof, decentralized ownership verification — no more forged land titles.
